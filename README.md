# hotspot-client
Hotspot is a dynamic web app allowing users to find the events happening at their desired distance and time, or apply filters to find events more suited to them. They may create account to save their preferences, log their event history and view recommendations. Clicking on an event allows them to view relevant information, including pricing, date and location. The project will use the eventful API to load the events and may work in conjunction with the google maps api for navigational details. In the future, we intend to offer guests features - allowing users to find events without the need for an account.
